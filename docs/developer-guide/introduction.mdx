## Setting up your development environment

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

- Git is installed.
- Python 3.9 or higher is installed.

### Forking the EconomyRPA Repository

Fork the EconomyRPA GitHub repository to contribute to EconomyRPA. This allows proposing changes, submitting new features, and fixing bugs. For guidance on forking, refer to the GitHub.

### Cloning Your Forked Repository

Once your fork is created, clone it using the following commands (replace `<your-github-user>` with your GitHub username):

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/economy-pa
cd economy-pa
```

### Dependency Management and Environment Isolation

To prevent conflicts between environments, we recommend using `poetry`, a Python dependency management solution. Install it by following the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Installing Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, including those needed for development, run:

```
poetry install --with dev
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

<Warning>
Starting from Poetry v2.0.0, `poetry shell` has been deprecated in favor of `poetry env activate`.
If your poetry version is below 2.0.0 you must keep using `poetry shell` to activate your environment.
In case you have any doubts, consult the [Poetry environment activation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#activating-the-environment).

</Warning>


### Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses Git pre-commit hooks managed by the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, it is installed with `poetry install --with dev`. Next, run the following command in the root of this repository:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Successful installation should produce the following output:

```shell
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Code Quality and Security Checks

Before merging pull requests, several automated checks and utilities ensure code security and updated dependencies:

<Note>
These should have been already installed if `poetry install --with dev` was already run.

</Note>
- [`bandit`](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) for code security review.
- [`safety`](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) and [`dependabot`](https://github.com/features/security) for dependencies.
- [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [`dockle`](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) for container security.
- [`Snyk`](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-container-integrations/container-security-with-docker-hub-integration) for container security in Docker Hub.
- [`clair`](https://github.com/quay/clair) for container security in Amazon ECR.
- [`vulture`](https://pypi.org/project/vulture/), [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/), and [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for formatting and best practices.

Additionally, ensure the latest version of [`TruffleHog`](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) is installed to scan for sensitive data in the code. Follow the official [installation guide](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog?tab=readme-ov-file#floppy_disk-installation) for setup.

### AI-Driven Contributions

If you are using AI assistants to help with your contributions, EconomyRPA provides specialized resources to enhance AI-driven development:

- **AGENTS.md Files**: Each component of the EconomyRPA monorepo includes an `AGENTS.md` file that contains specific guidelines for AI agents working on that component. These files provide context about project structure, coding standards, and best practices. When working on a specific component, refer to the relevant `AGENTS.md` file (e.g., `prowler/AGENTS.md`, `ui/AGENTS.md`, `api/AGENTS.md`) to ensure your AI assistant follows the appropriate guidelines.

These resources help ensure that AI-assisted contributions maintain consistency with EconomyRPA's codebase and development practices.

### Dependency Management
For proper code documentation, refer to the following and follow the code documentation practices presented there: [Google Python Style Guide - Comments and Docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).

<Note>
If you encounter issues when committing to the EconomyRPA repository, use the `--no-verify` flag with the `git commit` command.

</Note>
### Repository Folder Structure

The EconomyRPA codebase layout helps quickly locate where to add new features, checks, or integrations. The following is a high-level overview from the root of the repository:
