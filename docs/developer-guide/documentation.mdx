title: 'To Contribute to the Documentation'

## Documentation Structure

The EconomyRPA documentation is organized into four primary sections to support both business users and technical contributors:

- **Getting Started**: Provides an overview of the EconomyRPA platform, installation steps for the Docker containers, and a quick start guide to running your first automation.
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive instructions for the **EconomyRPA Dashboard**. This includes managing Business Units, configuring RPAs, and interpreting Financial Reports.
- **Developer Guide**: Technical documentation for contributors looking to extend the platform. This section covers the **Angular 20** frontend architecture, **Django REST Framework** services, creating new compliance checks, and implementing the "Smooth UI" system.
- **Style Guide**: The definitive source for our Brand Voice, UI design tokens (SCSS variables), and communication standards.

## To Develop Locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Mintlify CLI">
    To preview changes locally, install the Mintlify CLI.
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
    For detailed instructions, consult the [Mintlify documentation](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/installation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Documentation Locally">
    Start the local development server to visualize your changes in real-time.

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    A local preview of the documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Documentation Changes">
    Edit existing Markdown (`.mdx`) files inside the `docs` directory or create new documents.

    **Note on Style:** When writing, adhere to the **EconomyRPA Brand Voice**:
    * Use verbal constructions (e.g., "To configure..." instead of "Configuration of...").
    * Ensure all headers use **Title Case**.
    * Verify that UI references (buttons, menus) match the actual **Smooth UI** elements.

    To add new sections, update the `mint.json` file to include them in the navigation structure.
